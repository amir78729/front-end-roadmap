# React Online Store

This is a simple online store project built with Vite. The project fetches product data from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) and implements basic authentication. The shopping cart data is stored in the browser's local storage.

## Features

- **Login Page**: Basic authentication for accessing the cart.
- **Home Page**: Displays a list of products fetched from the Fake Store API.
- **Product Page**: Shows detailed information about a specific product.
- **Cart Page**: Displays the list of items in the shopping cart.

## Design

The design should be similar to [Digikala](https://digikala.com), but in English! (because the API results are in English)

## Required Packages

For implementing this project, you should use these packages:

- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Material-UI**: A popular React UI framework for building responsive web applications.
- **React Query**: A data-fetching library for React that provides hooks for fetching, caching, and updating asynchronous data.
- **Sass**: A CSS preprocessor that adds features like variables, nesting, and mixins to CSS.

## User Stories

> _A user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer. ([Atlassian website](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories))_

1. As a user, I want to be able to view a list of products on the home page so that I can see what items are available for purchase.
    
2. As a user, I want to be able to click on a product to view more details about it so that I can make an informed decision about whether to purchase it.
    
3. As a user, I want to be able to add items to my shopping cart so that I can keep track of the items I want to purchase.
    
4. As a user, I want to be able to view my shopping cart so that I can see what items I have added and how much they cost.

6. As a user, I want to be able to log in to my account so that I can access my shopping cart and view my order history.
    
7. As a user, I want to be able to log out of my account so that I can protect my personal information.
        
8. As a user, I want to be able to search for products by name or category so that I can find specific items more easily.
    
9. As a user, I want to be able to sort products by price or rating so that I can find the best deals or the highest-rated items.
        
10. As a user, I want to be able to view product images so that I can see what the item looks like before I purchase it.

11. As a user, I want the online store application to be responsive so that I can access and use it seamlessly on different devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
